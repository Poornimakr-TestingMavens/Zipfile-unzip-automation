📜 Key Components
🔹 ExcelValidator (pages/zipFileOpen.ts)

Reads Excel files into a 2D array.

Validates actual vs expected Excel data row-by-row.

const actualData = ExcelValidator.readExcelFile('path/to/file.xlsx');
const isValid = ExcelValidator.validateExcelData(actualData, expectedData);

🔹 FileHelper (utils/excelHelper.ts)

Unzips Excel files into folders.

Finds .xlsx files inside extracted folders.

const folders = FileHelper.unzipFile(zipPath, extractDir);
const excelFiles = FileHelper.getExcelFilesInFolder(folders[0]);

🔹 ExcelValidationData (utils/excelDataValidation.ts)

Stores expected data for validation in a parameterized way.

export const ExcelValidationData = {
  'Asia.xlsx': [
    ['Country', 'Capital'],
    ['India', 'New Delhi'],
    ['China', 'Beijing']
  ]
};

🔹 Playwright Test (tests/example.spec.ts)

Defines step-by-step test flow:

Extract zip file.

Collect all Excel files.

Validate their contents against ExcelValidationData.

**Example Test Run Output**
Extracted Asia.xlsx → test-data/extracted/Asia
Extracted India.xlsx → test-data/extracted/India
Validation passed for Asia.xlsx in folder Asia
Validation passed for India.xlsx in folder India
